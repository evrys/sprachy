id: "dative"
title: "Dem Dativ"
shortdesc: "When something is _kinda_ affected by a verb"
---

The dative noun case is used when referring to the _indirect object_ of a sentence. What's an indirect object? 
Something that is affected by a verb, but is not the direct object. Like the recipient of a gift:

::TextHighlighter{parts="actor, directobject, indirectobject"}
[The boy] gives [the squirrel] [the almond].
::

In English, we know whether an object is direct or indirect by the order of the words. "the boy gives the almond 
the squirrel" would have a totally different meaning! In German, the word order is much more flexible, because
you can tell the indirect object from the use of the dative case instead. These two sentences have the same meaning:

::TextHighlighter{parts="actor, directobject, indirectobject"}
[Der Junge] gibt [dem Eichhörnchen] [die Mandel].
::

::TextHighlighter{parts="actor, directobject, indirectobject"}
[Der Junge] gibt [die Mandel] [dem Eichhörnchen].
::

When referring to the indirect object, masculine and neuter nouns use the dative case _dem_. This word _dem_ is 
unique to the dative case, so it's great for quickly interpreting a sentence. Meanwhile, feminine nouns change 
from the nominative _die_ to dative _der_.

::LTable
_ / Masculine / Feminine / Neuter / Plural
Nominative / der / die / das / die
Dative / **dem** / **der** / **dem** / **den**
::

The plural also has the quirk that it adds an **-n** to the end of the noun, if it doesn't already have one.

::DialogueExample
squirrel:
Lasst uns mehr Mandeln unter **den** Bäume**n** suchen.
Let us seek more almonds among the trees.
::DialogueExample

::Tip{title="Der Frau"}
Be careful not to confuse the feminine dative _der_ with the masculine nominative _der_, or the plural dative _den_ with 
the masculine accusative _den_. While spelled the same, they are effectively different words.<br><br> If you know the 
gender/plurality of the noun you can reliably distinguish them; otherwise, you'll have to rely on contextual clues to 
the dativeness, e.g. the use of an intransitive verb like _helfen_.
