Some non-English languages have a standard way to modify nouns to create _diminutives_. This is a particularly wonderful feature that lets you take a word and make it more "cute", emphasizing its littleness and smallness.

die Katze / das Kätzchen
das Brot / das Brötchen
der Pantoffel, das Tier / das Pantoffeltierchen

Do you see the pattern? These kinds of diminutives are always neuter, no matter what gender the base word originally had! So even if you haven't seen a specific word before, you know you can use _das_ if it ends in _-chen_.

Diminutives can also end in _-lein_, which is similarly always _das_, but this is much less common than _-chen_ in modern German. Words ending in _-lein_ tend to sound pretty old-fashioned.

Some nouns are used mainly in their diminutive form. For example, _das Eichhörnchen_ is more common than _das Eichhorn_. _das Mädchen_ refers to a young girl, while the root _die Magd_ (the maid) would sound very archaic in comparison.
