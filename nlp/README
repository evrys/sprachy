The `nlp` directory contains natural language processing code to
manipulate data for Sprachy. Since the datasets themselves can be quite large,
they aren't kept in the Git repository, but rather on Dropbox.

To use the data with the code, symlink it in:

$ ln -sf ~/Dropbox/Sprachy/data data

You will want [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install the required Python 
packages and activate the virtualenv.

$ poetry install
$ poetry shell

Try not to write too much stuff in Python-- it's nicer if it's in TS since we can
use it in other parts of the app as well!
